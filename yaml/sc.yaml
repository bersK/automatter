  # This is the sample structure I am hoping to go forward with
  # The idea is to have prebuilt scripts that do something already
  # and build quickly scenarios out of those scripts and automate in some way
  # running said scripts/scenarios
  scenarios:
    scenario1:
      - script1
      - script2
      - script3
    scenario2:
      - script1
      - script2
      - script3
